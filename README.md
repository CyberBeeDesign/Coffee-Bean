  Coffee Bean
</h1>

For this project, I created a coffee shop landing page as part of my personal portfolio. If this website were for a client, it would include six pages; however, for the purpose of this exercise, I focused on building only the home page and the contact page.

This assignment required the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the website was deployed on GitHub using GitBash.
