  Coffee Bean
</h1>

I designed and developed a coffee shop landing page as part of my personal portfolio. While a full client website would typically include six pages, for this project, I concentrated on building just the home page and the contact page to showcase essential functionality and design.

The project involved using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the completed website was deployed on GitHub using GitBash.

<h2>Animation Features</h2>
I implemented CSS animations to enhance the interactivity of buttons and the top navigation menu. Additionally, I used JavaScript to create a dynamic coffee selection feature: when a visitor clicks on a coffee image, the background changes to creat an engaging user experience.
